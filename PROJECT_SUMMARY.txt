================================================================================
⏱️ DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE
================================================================================

OPTION A: MVP (Get Revenue in 2-3 weeks)
   Week 1: Shopping cart + Orders (18 hours)
   Week 2: Hosting activation + Dashboard (16 hours)
   Week 3: Polish + Deploy (6 hours)
   Result: Users can buy and use hosting

OPTION B: Full Platform (3-4 months)
   Same as A, then add:
   Week 3-4: Control Panel (40 hours)
